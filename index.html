          <!-- ABOUT ME-->
    <article>
    <h2 style="text-align:center"> Get to know Maria</h2>
    <p>  With a background in operations management, I have a passion leading and developing teams to achieve overall effective and efficient processes & routines. I have a passion for helping others and solving problems. </p>
    <p> In my most recent role, I found myself dabbling in data analytics but ultimately decided that it was not for me entirely. However, because I did enjoy writing code using SQL, I got busy networking to see where else I could write code and found software development. My ultimate goal is to build websites/apps for clients but right now I am really enjoying back-end development. As I have been in the Thinkful program, I have been challenged but when my code comes together I feel like a proud parent!</p> 
    <p> I am a newbie to development but you may recall a little site called MySpace, which is where I got my first experience writing code. Well, that was HTML and not JavaScript, but that is where I began to learn that I enjoyed solving problems and making things work that were either previously broken or not efficient. </p>
    <p> As you are exploring my page, please feel free to <a href="#contact">contact me</a>,<!-- PSEUDO-CLASS FOR CONTACT ME--> if you are in search of a new developer eager and ready to learn more or if you just want some collaboration on your next hackathon, I'm your developer! I enjoy working with others as a way to not only help in any way that I can, but to also learn and share ideas to ensure the best possible outcomes!
